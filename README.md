# AR_save_wildlife_unity
This was a project for Hack Your Reality hackathon on hackerearth. It's build on top of GoogleARcore library using unity engine. 

# Objective
To find a way to make people aware of the current grievous situation of the wildlife animals and help them know various ways through which they can contribute on an individual level and try to improve the current situation with the help of an interactive AR game for various wildlife protection organizations like WWF.

# Motivation 
1) Make an interactive AR Game, in which people can make their own wildlfie environment. 
2) Through this game people can be made aware about the problem and also educate them on how they can individually help on any level to eradicate this problem. 
3) There will be tasks which will be given to the users that they will have to complete every week to get extra points in the game. (This will be regularly updated through database, which can be done easily. But we were not able to because of time constraint and our college exams) 
4) Donations can be done to the various wildlife organisations through the app.
